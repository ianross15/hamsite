# Ian's Ham Radio Site (starter)

This is a minimal static starter site for a ham radio personal site. Contents:
- `index.html` — front page and anchors for sections
- `styles.css` — minimal responsive styling
- `script.js` — theme toggle
- `data/log.csv` — optional logbook sample

How to use
1. Edit `index.html` to replace CALLSIGN, email, and station details.
2. Add photos to `images/`.
3. Commit to your GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Branch: main / root).
4. (Optional) Use a static site generator (Hugo/Eleventy) if you want many posts or Markdown-driven content.

Quick publish: create the repository on GitHub under your account and push these files to the `main` branch. In repo Settings → Pages select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)` to publish. The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/hamsite` (or `https://<username>.github.io` if repo named `<username>.github.io`).

If you want, I can add:
- an interactive CSV log viewer (client-side)
- a Leaflet/OpenStreetMap antenna map
- Eleventy markdown template for projects
- photo gallery grid

Reply with any changes (callsign, email, extras) and I’ll update the repo.
